# RTPCA_Traffic-Anomaly-Detection
A tensor-based anomaly detection method for high-dimensional spatial-temporal data. 

Anomaly detection for high-dimensional spatial-temporal data is one of the most popular topics in contemporary machine learning research. Effictively detecting anomalies can help us to better understand abnormal patterns from data, and predict potential novelties in future. In this study, we provide a tensor-based feature extraction and anomaly detection framework which takes the spatial and temporal correlations into consideration. The framework consists of two steps, where the first one is a robust tensor decomposition capturing the spatial correlations and temporal smoothness of anomalies. The decomposition can also help to impute missing data which is very common in urban data analysis. The second step provides four anomaly deteciton techniques basing on anomaly scores from Mahalbanious distance, data median, One-class Support Vector Machine, and Isolation Forest.

The python module RPTCA provides all the methods for model estimation and anomaly prediction. The traffic data can be treated as a object called Robust_Tensor. The methods for this objects (in python OOP) includes model fitting, plot training histiory, and predcting anomalies. The python module Traffic_data_generator can generate synthetic traffic data for simulation study. The jupyter notebook provides an example for using the RTPCA study and predict anomalies for synthetic data.
